blocking bugs:

 - Sometimes a mounted computer player step out of the screen and disappears.
 There is a coloring problem in the frame where he exit. From that point his
 casts source is one of the remaining wizard, and you can kill his creatures but
 not the wizards as he is off screen.

 - Sometimes a computer wizard disappears off the bottom of the screen.
 After this occurs the wizard is invisible for the duration of the game and
 when the wizard casts a spell it is generated by another wizard. - **I've seen
 this on occasions -RQ**

 - Occasionally opponents are able to fire (centaur, wizard with a bow, elf
 etc) at my wizard even though there is no line of sight due to my creatures
 being in the way (this occurs with both 'real' and undead creatures blocking
 the line of sight) - **I wonder if this is caused by the "pixel-perfect" line
 of sight? -RQ**

 - Occasionally when my wizard is mounted, for example on a Centaur, and I am
 next to an opponent, or one of his creatures, when selecting the Centaur I am
 offered the option to dismount. If I select no sometimes I am not offered the
 option of attacking the opponent. - **Need more info -RQ**

 - <strike>If I successfully put another wizard's creature to sleep and that
 wizard is then killed the sleeping creature is not destroyed.</strike>
 **Cannot reproduce**

 - Towards the end of a game if an opponent wizard runs out of spells and start
 casting the 'meditation' spell the wizard's creatures start behaving
 erratically. They just seem to move back and forth or don't move at all. -
 **Sadly, yes, I have seen this too -RQ**
